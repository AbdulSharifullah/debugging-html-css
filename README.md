# Debugging Assignment Files

Welcome to the Debugging Assignment repository! This repository contains the resources for the debugging assignment in the Web Design Tools course. Students will debug the provided HTML and CSS files to meet W3C standards and accessibility guidelines.

## Files Included

1. **index.html**
   - Contains intentional errors for students to identify and fix.
   - Includes issues such as:
     - Missing or misused HTML tags.
     - Incorrect nesting of elements.
     - Accessibility violations (e.g., missing `alt` attributes).
     - Improper heading structure.

2. **style.css**
   - Contains various CSS errors for debugging.
   - Includes issues such as:
     - Syntax mistakes.
     - Invalid property names or values.
     - Incorrect or overly specific selectors.
     - Misplaced or redundant properties.

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to:
- Develop debugging skills by identifying and correcting errors in HTML and CSS.
- Improve familiarity with W3C standards and accessibility best practices.
- Practice working with external stylesheets and semantic HTML.

## Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` and `style.css` files in your favorite text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. Identify and correct the errors in both files. Pay special attention to:
   - HTML syntax and structure.
   - CSS rules and selectors.
   - Accessibility improvements.
